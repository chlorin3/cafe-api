# cafe-api
This Flask REST API allows you to search for cafes by location, retrieve data on all cafes, get a random cafe, add a new cafe to the database, update the coffee price for a particular cafe and delete a cafe. The API is fully RESTful and uses HTTP methods GET, POST, PATCH, and DELETE to perform the desired operations. It returns a JSON object.
